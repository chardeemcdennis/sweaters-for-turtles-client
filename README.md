## Team story:
In brainstorming ideas for the store/e-commerce setup for the Nozama project, Ben mentioned that he thought it would be interesting to have something similar to Regretzy, a site that listed the most ridiculous items from Etsy. Katie mentioned that there was a wonderful Etsy seller that offered sweaters for turtles. We found the image that she was talking about and it was so wonderful that we had to see if we could find more. In our search, we found so many wonderful sweaters that we absolutely had to make it happen! So, we launched directly into Sweaters for Turtles, a Nozama company.

## Client Story:
Sweaters for Turtles, Nozama company, is the largest retailer of animal sweaters and they’ve been at the top of the industry for the past twenty years. However, with the advent of Etsy, they’ve noticed a steady decline of sales, as some users have switched to niche and craft sellers. As the leader in the market, Nozama has decided to create their own hub where crafters can sell their products through their platform and bring the whole market on board to their product.
For the first version of their product they want a customer to be able to go to their site, browse through available items, add selected items to a shopping cart and purchase them using stripe payment processing. After an order has been placed the customer should be able to go back to the order to get updates as well as view their order history.

## User stories:
 - I want to get sweaters for my turtles.
 - I want to be able to see many options for turtle sweaters.
 - I want to easily add sweaters to my shopping cart.
 - I want to look at my shopping cart to see my running bill.
 - I want to be able to choose a quantity of sweaters to buy.
 - I want my progress to remain intact when I refresh the web page.
 - I want to be able to delete items from my cart.
 - I want to be able to see my previous orders so I do not buy duplicates.
 - I want to be able to pay with credit card via Stripe.

## Building the Application
Each day of the building process began with a stand-up to discuss any updates on processes, outstanding issues, and an outline for the day/work-period. The team spent several hours planning the development of SfT, including developing user stories and wireframes. The team worked through the user stories and developed modules for each one that corresponded to actions in both the front- and back-ends. We then created to-do lists in Trello for each action item, and marked them off upon completion. The team pair-programmed to tackle the action items, from high-priority to low.

## Technologies used:
HTML5, CSS, Handlebars, JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, Express, Trello, Atom

## Challenges
The SfT team faced many challenges. Perhaps the most challenging was integrating the third-party API, Stripe, for processing payment.
